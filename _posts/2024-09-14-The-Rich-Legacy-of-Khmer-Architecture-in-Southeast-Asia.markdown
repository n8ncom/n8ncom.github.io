Khmer architecture, known for its grandeur and intricate designs, has left a lasting impact across Southeast Asia. This architectural style flourished during the Khmer Empire, which peaked between the 9th and 15th centuries. The most iconic example is [Angkor Wat](https://fr.edu.vn/en/Angkor_Wat), built by King Suryavarman II. Beyond Cambodia, significant Khmer ruins can be found in Thailand, Laos, and even parts of Vietnam. This blog post explores the various Khmer sites, their historical significance, and their architectural features.
### Khmer Temples in Thailand
Thailand is home to numerous Khmer temples, showcasing a blend of cultural influences.

These temples were often constructed during the reigns of prominent Khmer kings such as Suryavarman II and Jayavarman VII. The temples feature characteristic elements that define Khmer architecture, including intricate bas-reliefs and towering prangs.
